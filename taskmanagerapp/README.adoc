== To run in "dev" mode

This runs things in a local "dev" mode by using the in-memory H2 database.

From the command-line:

----
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
...
----

Build a runnable JAR
----
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/spring-and-angular-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
...
----

Or from your IDE, run `Application.main`.

From there, navigate to http://localhost:8080/home.


You can also build and run as an executable JAR file:

----
$ mvn package
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=production target/spring-and-angular-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
